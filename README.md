## Getting Started 

### Installing 

Install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

## Hello, World! 

Open VSCode and start a new file. Add

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This allows the broswer to know what version of HTML you're coding in!

Now, add 

```
<html>
```
The text editor will automatically fill in the "<\html>". (pretty cool huh? ( ͡º ͜ʖ ͡º) )

Within the <html>, add
```
<head>
```
